This application allows the user to navigate through a database of products on an e-commerce site. It only includes the back end code for the website. Using an API-interacting application like Insomnia, the user can make different requests to view, add, edit, and delete items in this e-commerce database using the code created here. The website's merchandise is defined by several attiributes in the database that can be manipulated with this app: products, categories, and tags.
